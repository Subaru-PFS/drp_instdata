This is the relevant observed and reduced ISAAC data used for the
Rousselot, Lidman, et al. paper (2000A&A...354.1134R). I think it is
available from various sources, but this was sent to JEG by Chris
Lidman in 2012-09. The original data cover up to ~2.25AA, but I am not
including any of the files which do not overlap the PFS range.

Note that the O2 lines at the start of the 1.2AA O2 band are
identified in the paper.
