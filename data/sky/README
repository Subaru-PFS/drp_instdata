This package contains files to help compute sensitivies, etc, for the
SuMIRe PFS spectrograph. There are 4 text files which explain what
is in the files:

sumireTP.txt  explains the data for computing the throughput

sumiresetup.txt  explains the assumed spectroscopic setup; gratings,
    angles, resolving power, etc.

sensitivityFiles.txt explains the files in which you will find 
    throughputs, sky brightness, extinction, and crude sensitivity numbers.

skyHRfiles.txt explains how the sky brightness was generated.

It is assumed that you have or can write code to generate functions or
at least interpolate in ascii tables, though the sensitivity files
sumireCOLOR.dat give values for every pixel. The headers and comments
for all of the data files are marked by a '\' in column 1, which is
a comment character in Forth. You can change this to a '#' or ';' or
whatever your code needs. The tables are equally spaced in wavelength
for almost all the files (but are NOT in sumireTP.dat; careful).
