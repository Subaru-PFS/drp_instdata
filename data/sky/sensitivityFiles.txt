                The SuMIRe Sensitivity Files
                    Jeg 10/11/09

There are three sensitivity files in this package:

sumireBLUE.dat
sumireRED.dat
sumireIR.dat

They correspond to the blue, red and IR channels described by
the file sumiresetup.txt, which gives the spectroscopic parameters
for the three channels.

They give pixel-based data on object sensitivity and sky flux
assuming the wavelength ranges displayed in the header, from
Lamlo to Lamhi (Angstroms). Neff is the effective number of lines
in the grating, assumed here to be about a third of the total real
number of lines; this parameter is necessary to calculate the 
wing scattering of the OH lines (see the text description of the 
sky files, skyHRFiles.txt, for a full description). Rcen is the resolving
power at the center of the range, assuming that the FWHM is set
by the fiber footprint. Rpix is the central *pixel* resolving power, just
lam/(dlam) where dlam is the wavelength range represented by
one pixel. The ratio of these is just the FWHM in pixels. Npix is
4096, the assumed pixel number in the detector, and dlam is as
described above.

The next table is the percentage of the pixels in which the sky
is fainter than the indicated AB magnitude, in three contiguous
wavelength bands for each channel; the boundaries are at the
head of the table. So for example, in sumireBLUE.dat, 65 percent
of pixels are fainter than 22.13 in the range 3800-4766, 22.18 in
the range 4766-5733, and 21.50 in the range 5733-6700.

The main table gives, for each pixel, the wavelength of the pixel, the
sky flux density in nanoMaggies per square arcsecond (The unit of flux
density in all these tables is the nanoMaggie.  One maggie is the AB
flux of a 0.0 mag AB object, 3631 Janskys or 3.361e-20 erg/sec/cm^2/Hz,
so a nanoMaggie is 3.361e-29 erg/sec/cm^2/Hz, or 3.631 microJanskys.  A
source of AB=22.50 has a flux density of 1 nanoMaggie.), the equivalent
AB magnitude (just -2.5*log10(flux density in Maggies)), the total
throughput of the instrument/telescope, the total throughput of the
instrument/telescope/atmosphere, the detected photon count per
*kilo*second of exposure for a 1 nanoMaggie source, the count per
kilosecond from the sky, and the S/N of a 1 nM source in 1000 sec of
exposure.  These S/Ns are for a 1-pixel *WIDE* piece of the spectrum;
the fiber image is more than 3 pixels *HIGH*, and the read noise
(assumed 3 electrons for the CCDs, 4 for the IR device) is properly
included.  The noise-equivalent height of the spectrum is 3.5 pixels, so
the read noise contribution is the pixel read noise times sqrt(3.5). 

Note that the area of a 1.13" (100 micron fiber) at the Subaru
focal plane is almost exactly 1 square arcsecond, so you can think about
these fluxes as fiber fluxes.

To reach the resolution of the instrument, typically several
pixels are averaged together, and to reach reasonable resolution for
continuum studes of galaxies, for example, *many* pixels are averaged
together; R=500 to 1000 are reasonable, My next task is to produce
tables of sensitivity at various resolutions, taking into accout the sky
variance in the proper way.
