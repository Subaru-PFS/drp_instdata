            SuMIRe PFS Throughput
              Jeg 10/11/09

********* and remove this text from there ********

The total instrument throughput is the product of several factors, some
of which are introduced below, and others of which are summarized in the
table in the file sumireTP.dat. In that file, you will find:

Column 1: Wavelength in Angstroms
Column 2: QE of Hamamatsu 2-layer AR coat CCD for red and blue, 
Column 3: Teledyne IR QE, 1.8u material substrate removed for IR
Column 4: Transmission of 50M of Polymicro FBP fiber
Column 5: Measured good aluminum coat (Subaru primary) 
Column 6: Corrector data supplied by Miyazaki-san; no vignetting in this

other factors:
  1. Corrector vignetting -- assumed 0.90; this is a reasonable average 
      over field
  2. Fiber coupling --- assumed 0.90
  3. Camera/collimator throughput, including vignetting, assumed 0.86
  4. Dichroic throughput -- assumed f=0.95 at each reflection/transmission
      in band. Band edges defined by a crossover wavelength \lambda_0 
      (reflection=transmission=0.5f) and a width w (10%-90%) of f, assumed
      to be 2 percent of \lambda_0. The functional form used is
      cuton(x) = exp(x)/(exp(x) -1)
      cutoff(x) = 1 - cuton(x)
      where x = 2.1972*(\lambda - \lamda_0)/w
  5. gratings. Data were supplied by Jim Arns, Kaiser optical; the
      are design numbers, but the gratings they have made for us meet
      these almost exactly; the following are simple interpolation
      formulae which fit these data: ( lam is wavelength in *MICRONS*)
      BLUE: 0.88 - 0.60*(1/lam - 1/0.490)^2
      RED:  0.91 - 1.72*(1/lam - 1/0.764)^2
      IR:   0.91 - 1.75*(lam - 1.10)^2 

These factors combine to give the total throughput; finally, one has to 
mutiply by the sky transparency, in the file MKextinction.dat. This
file was generated by combining the continuum opacity from the
CFHT observing material (which I checked with various results from
other sites; it makes sense) and detailed molecular calculations/observations
for the oxygen A and B bands and the water bands from several sources; 
longward of 9000A I used the detailed models from Gemini. All
assume a precipitable water column of 1.6 mm and the mean pressure on the
summit of Mauna Kea.
